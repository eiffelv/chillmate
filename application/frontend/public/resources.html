                life stressors, and for relationship difficulties (to name a few). If you are 
                unsure whether psychotherapy is right for you, come set an appointment with 
                an intake therapist, discuss your concerns with him or her, and then decide 
                at that time if it is something that can be helpful for you. There is no 
                obligation to continue in therapy once you have come to the Psychology Clinic.
